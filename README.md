# Fire detection

## Teanm: AI_Engineers

### Objective:

One of the most common anomalies is fire accidents. This can happen due to short circuits in buildings and car accidents also might lead to fire. In this we build a fire detection system which detects fire from a CCTV surveillance video and sends an alert to the authorities.
